## Framewoking PHP 🐘

Following a tutorial by _[Laracasts](https://laracasts.com/series/php-for-beginners-2023-edition)_, this is an attempt to build a php framework from ground up.

I'm using [DDEV](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for handling the docker containers: nginx as webserver and a mysql DB.
